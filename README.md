#LO5R App

This app is to contain useful reference information for players while playing the tabletop roleplaying game: [Legend of the Five Rings by Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/legend-of-the-five-rings-roleplaying-game/).

Those interested in the game should reference the core rulebook and rely on experience in other tabletop roleplaying games if planning to run the game, but this app is supposed to serve as a resource to help a storyteller (GM) run the game for the players and allow players to have a quick reference.

This is a personal hobby project so while I wouldn't expect a lot from it, but if you do like the project and want to contribute or ask about features/issues, feel free to reach out to me.
