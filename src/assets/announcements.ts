    text: `Usersへ, There was downtime as I prepared the back and front end for version 2.0. Quite exciting huh? Here's the list of changes below:

    - [Weapons] and [Armors] now have direct links to their qualities!
    - Did I say [Armors]? Yes! We have an [Armor] table now!
    - Readability of titles is drastically improved! Sorry cool cursive font, you ain't all that!
    - New weapons and armors from the Unicorn book, and Celestial Realms, have been added!
    - All keyword links should have their logic improved. If they show up, they're working! If not, they may not have a page yet!
    - Keywords will automatically link to other pages as I add them, no more manually making them for me! I'm more excited about this than any of you will be.
    - Caching of heavily used data in the app means after one visit you have the fancy keywords and don't have to keep fetching
    - Lots of minor typo fixes since I had to stare at everything again, surprised what got by!
    - Improvements to some orders of things
    - Arrows! Yes, arrows are now a thing you can look up in the [Weapons] table, their [Qualities] will have further details!
    - Space is used a bit better on desktop views for the future. Tomorrow me thanks past me.
    - Links in discord and similar should have page-specific info (after crawlers cache it)
    
    Future Development: I am prioritizing optimizing caching for tables as well, which will take time to do.
    Then Advantages and Disadvantages are next.

    Enjoy! - Sachiekoより`,
