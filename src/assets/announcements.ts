    text: `There was downtime as I prepared the back and front end for version 2.0. Quite exciting huh?
    This is what the update entails in a bundle:
    - Weapons and Armors now have direct links to their qualities!
    - Did I say armors? Yes! I have armors in the backend, table will drop when I update this announcement!
    - Readability of titles is drastically improved! Sorry cool cursive font, you ain't all that!
    - New weapons and armors from the Unicorn book, and Celestial Realms, have been added!
    - All keyword links should have their logic improved. If they show up, they're working! If not, they may not have a page yet!
    - Keywords will automatically link to other pages as I add them, no more manually making them for me! I'm more excited about this than any of you will be.
    - Caching of heavily used data in the app means after one visit you have the fancy keywords and it saves data
    - Lots of minor typo fixes since I had to stare at everything again, surprised what got by!
    - Improvements to some orders of things
    - Arrows! Yes, arrows are now a thing you can look up in the weapon table, their qualities will have further details!
    - Space is used a bit better on desktop views for the future. Tomorrow me thanks past me.
    Enjoy, look forward to the fancy Armor table!`,
