    text: `Usersへ, there was downtime as I prepared the back and front end for version 2.0. Quite exciting huh?
    Here's the list of changes below:

    > [Weapons] and [Armors] now have direct links to their qualities!
    > Did I say [Armors]? Yes! We have an [Armor] table now!
    > Readability of titles is drastically improved! Sorry cool cursive font, you ain't all that!
    > New weapons and armors from the Unicorn book, and Celestial Realms, have been added!
    > All keyword links should have their logic improved. If they show up, they're working! If not, they may not have a page yet!
    > Keywords will automatically link to other pages as I add them, no more manually making them for me! 
      I'm more excited about this than any of you will be.
    > Caching of heavily used data in the app means after one visit you have the fancy keywords and don't have to keep fetching!
    > Lots of minor typo fixes since I had to stare at everything again, surprised what got by!
    > Improvements to some orders of things
    > Arrows! Yes, arrows are now a thing you can look up in the [Weapons] table, their [Qualities] will have further details!
    > Space is used a bit better on desktop views for the future. Tomorrow me thanks past me.
    > Links in discord and similar should have page-specific info (after crawlers cache it)
    > Changed the look and feel of the website, should be a bit more responsive after the initial visit as well!
    
    Future Development: I am prioritizing optimizing caching for tables as well, which will take time to do. 
    This is important because it means you can use far less data, which will be very important as this site grows.
    Advantages and Disadvantages are also planned, as well as different color schemes to support your favorite clans!

    Enjoy! - Sachiekoより`,
