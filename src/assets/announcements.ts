    title: "Latest Dev Update: Core Techniques Done!",
    text: `All Core Rulebook Techniques have reference information now! UI for techniques was improved slightly, and Critical Strikes also have a rules entry along with my playtested recommendation so critical strikes feel more meaningful. Keyword links added to and open a new tab instead of previous functionality.
    Next in Development: Unmasking rule entry with custom examples, Mass Battle Objectives rule entry, Armor table, add Ring type for Techniques table, and Advantage and Disadvantage quick reference table. Collecting feedback of how keyword links work currently compared to prev.
