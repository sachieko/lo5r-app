    text: `Usersへ, 

    Version 2.1 is now live. Changes below:

    * Techniques from Shadowlands and Path of Waves have been added.
    * This excludes the Gaikokujin exclusive talents due to their complex systems and lower priority.. because gaikokujin.
    * The techniques table now includes the rings used for rolls for optimal technique selecting, as highly requested.
    * Site styles have been updated to hopefully provide a slightly better experience on various devices.
    * A few backend updates. 
    * Added a menu link for those interested in adding a discord dice bot specifically tailored for Legend of the 5 Rings 5th edition. 
    * 20 Questions are under construction, stay tuned..
